- 👋 Hi, I’m @mahmoudabudaher
- 👀 I’m interested in assessing the translation of Arabic texts into English.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning translation and applied linguistics - Arabic to English and vice versa.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on correcting mistranslations of Arabic texts into English, and analyzing the Arabic text including equivalence, genre, imagery, cultural terms ...etc.
- 📫 How to reach me ... I'm available via the email: mahmoudabudaher@gmail.com.
